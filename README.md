# Vanilla Image Slider

I just realised when writing this readme that this is equivalent to what's called a "carousel" in most frameworks. Screw it, I'm calling it a slider.

This is one way of implementing a slider using only vanilla HTML/CSS/JS (no jQuery! No utility libraries!). It's designed to keep the HTML simple and mutable, the CSS customizable, and the JS a black box that you don't have to tinker with at all. It can be easily plopped into any webpage written by hand. It's also responsive to screen size by default.

It uses modern HTML/CSS/JS features that are probably not available for e.g. Internet Explorer or Netscape. But all modern browsers shouldn't have any trouble with it.

If you're using a framework like React, there's probably a more effective way of implementing this. This is just one way to do it.

The images I use for this sample came from the official page of the mobile game [SinoAlice](https://sinoalice.global/). I believe using it in this way fall under educational fair use.

I wrote a lengthy blog post about creating this in [my blog](https://pseudomon.wordpress.com/2020/04/12/creating-an-image-slider-with-vanilla-html-css-js/). It's probably more useful to people who are just starting out with front-end development.
